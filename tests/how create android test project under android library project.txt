How did I created a test inside android library itself using eclipse
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Create an android test from library
	- right click on library project root
	- Android Tools / New Test Project
	- set name to LibraryTest or something else
	- uncheck 'use default location'
	- fill with a folder on library root, whatever
	- a folder named LibraryTestTest will be created under library root
- Delete test project keeping its contents, yes delete! (uncheck 'delete project contents on disk')
- Rename LibraryTestTest to 'tests'
- Import 'Existing project into workspace' from 'tests'
- Modify AndroidManifest.xml from LibraryTest
	- change instrumentation tag, attribute android:targetPackage to 'library.test', i.e., add '.test'
- Create a new JUnit Test Case
	- choose JUnit 4, if you want
	- name a class, e.g., ClassTest
	- choose AndroidTestCase as superclass
	- choose which class will be target as test
- Run ClassTest as Android JUnit Test
- That's it!
